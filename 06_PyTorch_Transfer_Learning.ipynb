        "Transfer learning allows us to take the patterns (also called weights) another model has learned from another problem and use them for our own problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we can take the patterns a computer vision model has learned from datasets such as ImageNet (millions of images of different objects) and use them to power our FoodVision Mini model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or we could take the patterns from a language model (a model that's been through large amounts of text to learn a representation of language) and use them as the basis of a model to classify different text samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "The premise remains: find a well-performing existing model and apply it to your own problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why use transfer learning?\n",
        "There are two main benefits to using transfer learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Can leverage an existing model (usually a neural network architecture) proven to work on problems similar to our own.\n",
        "2. Can leverage a working model which has already learned patterns on similar data to our own. This often results in achieving great results with less custom data.\n"
